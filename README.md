Project Title: Evolution of Song Lyrics Throughout the Decades

Description: Analyzing trends and attributes in songs that have made the top ten hits lists for every year beginning 1960’s  Present
Not in order to prescribe exactly what characteristics make a hit, but rather to take a statistically significant sample from each decade and watch for an overall trend in song lyrics within popular music

Data: Billboard website Top 10 Hits per year since 1960; song lyrics pulled from Billboard

3-5 Initial Research Questions:
Variety/uniqueness of song lyrics in top hits
Number of one-hit-wonders vs. repeat artists
Solo artist / group
Song title
Year
Ranking
Artist

Techniques & Tools: build our own database, python, numpy, matplotlib

Data Shortcomings: potential challenges in getting lyrics with API

Hypothesis: there is a downward trend in the number and uniqueness of song lyrics
Null Hypothesis: there is NOT a downward trend in the number and uniqueness of song lyrics
1-3 Strong questions:
1)	Is the overall trend of unique words trending downward over the years
2)	Is there any correlation between number of unique words and hit ranking within each year over time
3)	What are the sub-trends within the top ten hits each year within Group vs. Solo Artist categorization
