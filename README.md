Project Title: "Trends in Music Chart Top 10 Hits from 1960-2017"

Description: Analyzing top ten hits between 1960 - 2017

Data: Billboard website's Top 10 Hits per year since 1960

Techniques & Tools: build our own database, python, matplotlib

Data Shortcomings: API with song lyrics did not include release year, therefor the project pivoted due to challenge in combining API lyrics with previously created database, as well as time constraints in finding and acquiring additional APIs that would include release dates. These challenges switched the focus of the project from song lyric analysis to the analysis of trends within artists, song titles, and group vs solo artists topping the charts between 1960-2017.

---------------------------

PREVIOUS PROJECT DETAILS:
Questions:
1)	Is the overall trend of unique words trending downward over the years
2)	Is there any correlation between number of unique words and hit ranking within each year over time
3)	What are the sub-trends within the top ten hits each year within Group vs. Solo Artist categorization

Hypothesis: there is a downward trend in the number and uniqueness of song lyrics

Null Hypothesis: there is NOT a downward trend in the number and uniqueness of song lyrics

---------------------------

POST-PIVOT PROJECT DETAILS:
Description: Analyzing top ten hits between 1960 - 2017 for the following questions:

Questions:
1) Percentage of artists that are one-hit-wonders vs those that have repeat hits

2) Gender popularity in top 10 hit song titles

3) Likelihood of solo artists vs groups/bands making a top 10 hit (avg / year)


Hypothesis 1: Artists/groups have less than a 10% chance of creating more than one Top 10 hit

Null Hypothesis 1: Artists/groups have greater than a 10% chance of creating more than one Top 10 hit

Hypothesis 2: Among the most popular song titles within top 10 hit song titles, the majority of them are about women 
Based on created gender dictionary for project: (she/her/woman/women/gal/girl/chick/lady/ladies) VS (he/his/man/men/pal/guy/dude/gentleman/gentlemen)

Null Hypothesis 2: Among the most popular song titles within top 10 hit song titles, the majority of them are about men 

Hypothesis 3: The likelihood of solo artists making a top 10 hit is greater than the likelihood of of groups making a top 10 hit

Null Hypothesis 3: The likelihood of solo artists making a top 10 hit is less than the likelihood of of groups making a top 10 hit
